### Summary

A simple static website that allows you to create and edit text files from within the browser.

This project was created during my 6th week of the JustIT software development boot camp after covering two weeks of javascript, two weeks of CSS and an initial week of HTML.

#### Note if you clone this Repository and run it locally it might not allow you to download any files due to most browsers blocking HTTP downloads.

##### The work around would be to use a tool such as [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
